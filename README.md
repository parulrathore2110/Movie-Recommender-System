# Movie-Recommender-System
A Python-based movie recommendation system using content-based filtering.

This project implements a Movie Recommender System, designed to suggest movies to users based on various attributes. The system leverages two primary datasets from The Movie Database (TMDB): tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv.

The core functionality involves processing these datasets to extract relevant movie characteristics such as:

movie_id: Unique identifier for each movie.
title: The title of the movie.
genres: Categories or types of the movie (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
keywords: Important words or phrases associated with the movie.
overview: A brief summary of the movie's plot.
cast: The main actors in the movie.
crew: Key personnel involved in the movie's production, including the director.
budget: The production budget of the movie.
popularity: A numerical score indicating the movie's popularity.
vote_average: The average rating given to the movie.
The system will use these features to provide intelligent movie recommendations, likely employing techniques such as content-based filtering, where recommendations are made based on the similarity of movie attributes.
